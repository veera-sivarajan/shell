A minimalistic shell written to learn pointers, system calls and manual memory allocations. It was originally written in C but it has been translated into Zig using ~zig translate-c~. The generated Zig source file can be built using the Zig compiler after applying the patch to fix https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/12110.
